## Project part 2 questions

- How much of UI (if any) to put on CRC
    - none
 
- does an admin have the abilities of both an organizer/admin?
    - tier above organizer, just extend 

- Are users required to create an account with a username and password upon starting the app? --> Or do users scan a QR code to start and a temporary profile (which the user can manually edit) is created for the event
  - device registration??? still not clear to even TAs
  - no login page for now
 
- risk level
  - do QR code thing first --> learn ourselves
 
## Project part 3 questions - answered in Mar 6 meeting

- does our home page make sense?
    - no, reference some app (Rogers place)
- is it okay to have the scan QR code in our navigation drawer (is it not accessible enough??)
    - that's okay, wouldnt want it on main page, better on the menu
- should we have the filtering already done? --> is filtering of events okay?
    - every event app should have that functionality, done past the halfway checkpoint
    - type of thing to show to prof to stand out
- switching to organizer mode??
- in our UML, do we need to put all classes or just the classes we currently have?

## Tyler Database Questions
- Storing items --> Should we store EVERYTHING in the Database? Any local storage allowed? What do you recommend? ( Think the answer to this is all in db ) 
- Does it make sense to have a single controller for all database related things? Or should I have several points that access db
  - Pros: Everything is in one place for the database
  - Cons: might be a long file + need connect it at several points ( maybe not that bad of an idea )
